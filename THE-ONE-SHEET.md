* Summary of game play
	
This game is stylized like a pong game. The player moves their paddle to bounce the ball of poison onto the enemy’s back space located on the right side of the screen. After the player has reached the maximum amount of points, they win the level. If they lose, they are shown the “game over” screen and are sent back to the level selection screen. Player will know exactly what level they are playing based on the character that is attached to the paddle and enemy attached to the opponent. 

* Description of the three levels of game play

	Level 1: Maryjane vs. Prince Venomax
Younger sister Maryjane faces off against the slow-paced younger twin Venomax to obtain a total of 3 points. Whichever player 
reaches 3 points first wins the level. But if the main player doesn’t reach 3 points in time, the game over screen will appear 
and the player will be redirected to the level selection screen. 
	Level 2: Maple vs. Princess Venomie
Middle sister Maple is attacked by the medium-paced Venomax’s twin sister Venomie and must defeat her in battle a total of 4
times to complete the level. But if Maple doesn’t reach 4 points in time, the game over screen will appear and
the player will be redirected to the level selection screen.

Whichever player reaches 5 points first wins the level. But if the main player doesn’t reach 5 points in time,
