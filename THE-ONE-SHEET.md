* Summary of game play
	
This game is stylized like a pong game. The player moves their paddle to bounce the ball of poison onto the enemy’s back space located on the right side of the screen. After the player has reached the maximum amount of points, they win the level. If they lose, they are shown the “game over” screen and are sent back to the level selection screen. Player will know exactly what level they are playing based on the character that is attached to the paddle and enemy attached to the opponent. 

* Description of the three levels of game play
